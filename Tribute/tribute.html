            <b>PERSONAL LIFE</b><br><br>
            Bill Gates, the renowned American entrepreneur and philanthropist, was born on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington. He is the son of William H. Gates Sr. and Mary Maxwell Gates and has two sisters, Kristi and Libby. In 1975, Gates co-founded Microsoft Corporation with Paul Allen, which revolutionized the computer software industry. Apart from his professional achievements, Gates is also known for his philanthropy. In 2000, he and his then-wife Melinda established the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, dedicated to addressing global health issues, poverty, and education. The couple has three children together: Jennifer, Rory, and Phoebe. Over the years, Gates has shown a keen interest in various hobbies, such as reading, puzzles, and playing bridge. He has made notable real estate investments, including his well-known mansion "Xanadu 2.0" in Medina, Washington. Gates has been an advocate for global health and has actively supported efforts to combat infectious diseases. As of my last update in September 2021, he and Melinda had announced their divorce but expressed their commitment to continue their philanthropic work together through their foundation. Please note that circumstances might have changed since then, and I recommend checking more recent sources for the latest updates on Bill Gates' personal life.
